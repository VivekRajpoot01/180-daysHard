In the early days of human existence, our primary activities revolved around basic needs - eating, hunting, and sleeping. These essential tasks were the essence of life itself.

During this time, we had no systematic way of counting things. If someone needed to count objects, there were no established methods. As time passed, humanity evolved and created various number systems. One such system that gained prominence is the decimal number system. It became prevalent because of its simplicity and ease of performing mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more.

## How People Count in the Decimal Number System

To understand this, let's look at the decimal number system, which includes the digits 0 through 9:


If we want to add 3 + 4 using this system, we follow these steps:

1. Begin at the number 3 on the number line.
2. Move the pointer 4 positions to the right.
3. Arrive at the position 7.
4. We have our answer: 3 + 4 = 7.

However, as the complexity of calculations increased, manual computation on paper became error-prone, especially for tasks involving large datasets or complex operations. This led to the need for a more reliable and efficient system.

After years of dedicated work, scientists introduced a groundbreaking invention: the computer. Early computers were massive, often filling entire rooms, but their primary purpose was calculation and computation without human error.

Fast forward to another significant milestone in technology - the transistor. This tiny device would change the world. Observing the operation of a transistor, we notice it can either be in one of two states:

- 1: Bulb glowing
- 0: Bulb not glowing

This binary concept laid the foundation for a new number system, the binary number system.
